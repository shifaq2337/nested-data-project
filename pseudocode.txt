Question: Of what year do you want to find out about the amount of water consumption in NYC (put any year from 1979 - 2016)? 
- user should be able to put any year from 1979 to 2016 and 
receive water consumption in NYC for that year:
-- NYC Consumption(Million gallons per day) and 
-- Per Capita(Gallons per person per day). 
-look for year if user_year matches with year inside data then return NYC Consumption(Million gallons per day) and Per Capita(Gallons per person per day). 

EC Question (if enough time): Do you want to know what the NYC population size for the year you put in earlier? 
-- If user says no ask "Do you want to know what the NYC population size was for any year from 1979 - 2016?"
--- If user says no again, stop running 
-If user puts yes ask "Please put in which year you want to find out about the NYC population size."

TRIAL 1 
puts water_consumption_data
puts water_consumption_data["data"][0][8] #gives the year
puts water_consumption_data["data"][0][10] # gives the NYC population water consumption number 
puts water_consumption_data["data"][0][11] # gives the individu water consumption number

TRIAL 2
puts "Of what year do you want to find out about the amount of water consumption in NYC (put any year from 1979 - 2016)?"
user_year = gets.chomp
    water_consumption_data["data"].each do |water_consumption_info|
        if water_consumption[8] == user_year
            puts "In #{water_consumption_info[8]}..."
            puts "#{water_consumption_info[10]} million gallons per day was consumed"
            puts "#{water_consumption_info[11]} gallons per person per day was consumed."
        end
    end
